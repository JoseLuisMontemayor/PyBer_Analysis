# PyBer_Analysis

### Project Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to find the relationship in several aspects between the 3 city types: Rural, Suburban and Urban. We will see data between drivers, fares and how the total types of rides are composed. We could work in this module thanks to the two .csv files that we practiced before; city_data and ride_data. Thanks to the DataFrames and new types of graphs introduced we could make the analysis as visual for anyone to understand the main topics transmitted thanks to this information. 

### Results

After the results, it is evident that more than 50% of the business depends on the Urban spaces. We can see the total rides, total drivers and total fares have a predominant space. PyBer needs itÂ´s almost complete attention on this business. It is followed by the suburban area, it is also important since the average fare per ride and the average fare per driver is more elevated than the Urban ones. And also to notice, that the average fares from the rural areas are even more higher, due to the less demand and the total drivers in which they surround.

To have a better visual of the last data, with the following image we can see the data of the distribution of total rides, for which the majority as mentioned is the Urban type (68.4%), followed by the Suburban by (26.3%) and the Rural with 5.3%.

Next we can see the total drivers by City type, first the Urban with 80.9%, followed by the Suburban with 16.5% and then the Rural with a minimum of 2.6%.

Then we can see the total fares by City Type, first the Urban with 62.7%, after the Suburban with 30.5% and the Rural with 6.8%. We need to take into account that even though the Urban have the majority of the total fares, the rural has the highest average fares, thanks to their demand and their total drivers.

### Total Fare by City Type

We can see that the results of the total fare by city type are not as different as we have seen before. For the Urban type it starte in January over $1,500 and has a little increase until March, which varies but continues with a sustainable trend. Then we have the Suburban Type, which starts over $500 and has a variation that not goes over $1,500 but ends with a positive trend. Then we have the Rural al the bottom, which starts over $0 and has a similar trend as the Suburban, it does not pass over $500. Visually a similar trend for in a high scope for the three types of cities.

### Summary

We can conclude after all this information, that the most important model for the company is the Urban one. It contains more than 50% of the business and would think that if any decisions were made, the first market that it needs to suit is the Urban. The average fares may be lower in the Urban, but thanks to the volume they have it is sustainable for the business. Also if they would want to increase participation in the other two markets they could decrease fares and have more drivers to have a better service.
