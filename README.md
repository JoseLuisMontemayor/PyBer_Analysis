# PyBer_Analysis

### Project Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to find the relationship in several aspects between the 3 city types: Rural, Suburban and Urban. We will see data between drivers, fares and how the total types of rides are composed. We could work in this module thanks to the two .csv files that we practiced before; city_data and ride_data. Thanks to the DataFrames and new types of graphs introduced we could make the analysis as visual for anyone to understand the main topics transmitted thanks to this information.
